MNIST Digits - Classification Using SVM

In this notebook, we'll explore the popular MNIST dataset and build an SVM model to classify handwritten digits.

We'll divide the analysis into the following parts:

Data understanding and cleaning
Data preparation for model building
Building an SVM model - hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation etc.

The final accuracy on test data is approx. 92%. Note that this can be significantly increased by using the entire training data of 42,000 images (we have used just 10% of that!).
